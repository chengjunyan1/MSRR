# MSRR-System
High-Level System and Mediator for Modular Self-Reconfiguration Robot (MSRR)

*by Cheng Jun-Yan*

**Prerequisite:** opencv2, apriltags3, ros, parrot-olympe, parrot-sphinx(for simulation)

This repository contains a MSRR High-Lvel System I developed for the term project in WPI RBE502 ROBOT CONTROL (This repository only showed my work in the project, its not the whole project). Final Repors folder contains my part in written final report and final presentation ppt. 

## I. How to use:

1.Run BootServer.py (args: 1 for listen ros. none for server., also need run the roscore)

2.Run DroneScript.py (args: 1 for init, none for keep streaming.)

3.Run MSRRScript.py (args: 1 for reset stage, none for continue.)

## II. How to Install Apriltags:

1.Download apriltags from https://github.com/AprilRobotics/apriltag (Or directly use apriltags.zip in /Coordinator)

2.Rename the folder 'apriltags', put it in Coordinator/

3.Enter the folder, then build it:

cmake .

make

## III. How to Activate drone env:

source ~/code/parrot-groundsdk/./products/olympe/linux/env/shell

## IV. How to launch drone simulation:

sudo systemctl start firmwared

sphinx /opt/parrot-sphinx/usr/share/sphinx/drones/anafi4k.drone::stolen_interface=

## V. How to modify

1.Write the MSRRScript.py to plan a high level task

2.Write the DroneScript.py to define the behavior of Drone. Or use Coordinator/drone.py to directly control it.

3.Modify configs.py and also parameters for planner, coordinator and actuator.
